The Judiciary Case Management System
<table><thead><tr><th>No</th><th>Workplan Item</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Project Title</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Project Overview</td><td>The Case Management System is designed to streamline the process of managing legal cases by providing a centralized platform for case management and case-related data. The system has the following key features:

Authentication & Authorization: Users are required to log in to the system using their unique credentials. The system has robust authentication and authorization features to ensure that only authorized users have access to the system and that they can only perform actions that they are authorized to perform.

Case Management & Profiling: The system allows users to create, manage and view cases. Each case has a unique case number and is associated with a set of case-related data, such as the parties involved, the case status, and the court in which the case is being heard. The system also allows for the creation of case profiles that contain detailed information about the case and its history.

Case Parties Profiling: The system allows for the creation of profiles for advocates and magistrates involved in the cases. These profiles contain information such as their contact details, qualifications, and case history.

Court Profile: The system allows for the creation of profiles for courts involved in the cases. These profiles contain information such as the court's location, jurisdiction, and case history.

Management Tracking of Files Movement: The system allows users to track the movement of case files within the court system. This feature provides real-time updates on the location of the case files and the status of the case.

Administration of Legal Fees: The system allows for the administration of legal fees for cases. This feature facilitates the calculation of legal fees for each case and provides the ability to generate invoices for the fees.

Reports: The system provides a set of predefined reports that can be generated based on user-specified criteria. The reports provide detailed information about cases, such as the status of cases, the number of cases pending, and the number of cases that have been closed. Additionally, the system allow users to create custom reports as well..</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Project Scope</td><td>The Case Management System is designed to provide a centralized platform for managing legal cases, case-related data and legal fees. The system will include the following functionalities:

Authentication and Authorization: Users will be able to log in to the system using their unique credentials and the system will have robust authentication and authorization features to ensure that only authorized users have access to the system and that they can only perform actions that they are authorized to perform.

Case Management: Users will be able to create, manage and view cases within the system. Each case will have a unique case number and will be associated with a set of case-related data, such as the parties involved, the case status, and the court in which the case is being heard. The system will also allow for the creation of case profiles that contain detailed information about the case and its history.

Case Parties Profiling: Users will be able to create profiles for advocates and magistrates involved in the cases. These profiles will contain information such as their contact details, qualifications, and case history.

Court Profile: Users will be able to create profiles for courts involved in the cases. These profiles will contain information such as the court's location, jurisdiction, and case history.

Management Tracking of Files Movement: Users will be able to track the movement of case files within the court system, which will provide real-time updates on the location of the case files and the status of the case.

Administration of Legal Fees: Users will be able to administer legal fees for cases. This functionality will facilitate the calculation of legal fees for each case and provide the ability to generate invoices for the fees.

Reports: The system will provide a set of predefined reports that can be generated based on user-specified criteria. The reports will provide detailed information about cases, such as the status of cases, the number of cases pending, and the number of cases that have been closed. Additionally, users will be able to create custom reports.

Constraints:

The system is designed for use in a legal environment and is not intended for use in other industries.

The system's functionality is based on a set of assumptions about the legal process and may not be suitable for use in jurisdictions with different legal processes.

The system is not intended to provide legal advice and should not be used as a substitute for the advice of a qualified legal professional.

Assumptions:

The system assumes that users have a basic understanding of the legal process and legal terminology.

The system assumes that users will have access to the necessary equipment and infrastructure to use the system, including computers and internet access.

The system assumes that users will receive the necessary training and support to use the system effectively.

The system is designed with the assumption that users will maintain their data accuracy, completeness, and data security.

This project scope will ensure that the system can be designed, developed, tested and implemented within the constraints of time, budget and resources. It also sets the expectations for the system's functionality and the level of support that will be provided for its use..</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Stakeholder List</td><td>List of all stakeholders, including their role, responsibilities, and contact information.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Agile Framework</td><td>In summary, Agile Scrum is an effective project management methodology for the Case Management System project as it provides an iterative and incremental approach, allows for prioritization and efficient management of the case files and legal fees, transparency and inspection, and collaboration, which are all crucial for the successful development and deployment of a comprehensive case management system.
