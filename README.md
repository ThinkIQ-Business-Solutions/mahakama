<table><thead><tr><th>No</th><th>Workplan Item</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Project Title</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Project Overview</td><td>The Case Management System is designed to streamline the process of managing legal cases by providing a centralized platform for case management and case-related data. The system has the following key features:

Authentication & Authorization: Users are required to log in to the system using their unique credentials. The system has robust authentication and authorization features to ensure that only authorized users have access to the system and that they can only perform actions that they are authorized to perform.

Case Management & Profiling: The system allows users to create, manage and view cases. Each case has a unique case number and is associated with a set of case-related data, such as the parties involved, the case status, and the court in which the case is being heard. The system also allows for the creation of case profiles that contain detailed information about the case and its history.

Case Parties Profiling: The system allows for the creation of profiles for advocates and magistrates involved in the cases. These profiles contain information such as their contact details, qualifications, and case history.

Court Profile: The system allows for the creation of profiles for courts involved in the cases. These profiles contain information such as the court's location, jurisdiction, and case history.

Management Tracking of Files Movement: The system allows users to track the movement of case files within the court system. This feature provides real-time updates on the location of the case files and the status of the case.

Administration of Legal Fees: The system allows for the administration of legal fees for cases. This feature facilitates the calculation of legal fees for each case and provides the ability to generate invoices for the fees.

Reports: The system provides a set of predefined reports that can be generated based on user-specified criteria. The reports provide detailed information about cases, such as the status of cases, the number of cases pending, and the number of cases that have been closed. Additionally, the system allow users to create custom reports as well..</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Project Scope</td><td>Detailed description of the project's scope, including any constraints or assumptions.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>Stakeholder List</td><td>List of all stakeholders, including their role, responsibilities, and contact information.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Agile Framework</td><td>Description of the Agile methodology that will be used, including the specific framework (e.g. Scrum, Kanban, etc.) and how it will be applied.</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>Sprint Timeline</td><td>Timeline of the sprints, including the start and end date of each sprint, and the number of sprints planned for the project.</td></tr><tr><td>7</td><td>Backlog</td><td>List of user stories and/or tasks that will be completed during the project.</td></tr><tr><td>8</td><td>Sprint Planning</td><td>Description of how sprint planning will be conducted, including who will be involved and what information will be used to plan each sprint.</td></tr><tr><td>9</td><td>Daily Stand-ups</td><td>Description of how daily stand-up meetings will be conducted, including who will be involved and the agenda for each meeting.</td></tr><tr><td>10</td><td>Sprint Review</td><td>Description of how sprint reviews will be conducted, including who will be involved and what will be reviewed at the end of each sprint.</td></tr><tr><td>11</td><td>Sprint Retrospective</td><td>Description of how sprint retrospectives will be conducted, including who will be involved and the format of each retrospective.</td></tr><tr><td>12</td><td>Backlog Grooming</td><td>Description of how backlog grooming will be conducted, including who will be involved and how often it will be done.</td></tr><tr><td>13</td><td>Roles and Responsibilities</td><td>List of the roles and responsibilities of the project team members, including the product owner, scrum master, and development team.</td></tr><tr><td>14</td><td>Change Management</td><td>Description of how change management will be handled, including how changes will be proposed, evaluated, and implemented.</td></tr><tr><td>15</td><td>Communication Plan</td><td>Plan for how communication will be managed throughout the project, including how stakeholders will be kept informed of project progress and how team members will communicate with each other.</td></tr><tr><td>16</td><td>Risk Management</td><td>Description of how risks will be identified, evaluated, and managed throughout the project.</td></tr></tbody></table>
